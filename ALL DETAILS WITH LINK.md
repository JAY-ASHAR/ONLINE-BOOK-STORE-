JAVA CONNECTIVITY WITH MYSQL

DESCRIPTION: -

MySQL was used for database management and Java for backend programming in the development of an online bookstore application. 

The project includes a registration page that allows users to manage their profiles and create accounts by seamlessly connecting to the MySQL database. 

This project demonstrates my ability to combine MySQL and Java for efficient data handling and user management in a practical application.
